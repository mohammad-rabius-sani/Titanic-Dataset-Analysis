# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset using SQL and Power BI. The project explores the survival rates based on various factors such as class, gender, fare, age, family size, and the port of embarkation. The insights gained from this analysis are visualized in an interactive dashboard created using Power BI.

## Project Overview
- **Tools Used**: SQL (BigQuery), Power BI
- **Data Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- **Objective**: To analyze the survival factors of the Titanic passengers and present the findings in a comprehensive dashboard.

## Key Insights
- Total Passengers: 891
- Survival Rate: 38.4%
- Majority of survivors were female (74.20%)
- Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate (63%)
- Age distribution of survivors peaked around age 27.5

## Project Files
- `data/` contains the cleaned Titanic dataset in CSV format.
- `analysis/` contains the SQL queries used for analysis.
- `images/` contains a screenshot of the Power BI dashboard.

## Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes the key findings from the dataset, including survival rates by class, gender, and age, as well as the top survivors by fare paid.

## Learning Outcomes
- This project provided an opportunity to work with real-world data and practice the following skills:

- Data Cleaning: Removed null and inconsistent values for more accurate analysis.
- Data Transformation: Used SQL queries to organize and transform raw data into meaningful insights.
- Data Visualization: Created interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Power BI, incorporating different types of charts (bar, pie, line) and slicers for dynamic filtering.
- Dashboard Design: Structured the dashboard to clearly convey the most critical information, making it intuitive and easy to interpret.
